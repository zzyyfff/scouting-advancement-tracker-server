# scouting-advancement-tracker-server

# Planning:

## Project Idea â€” What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

My project idea is an advancement tracking app for Scouts. Initially it will allow scouts to track and record their merit badges, but ideally will include rank, troop organization and roles, and the ability to connect with other scouts.

I came up with it whil reading about the recent inclusion of young women into what used to be call the Boy Scouts but is now called Scouts BSA. I was reflecting on my own positive experices as a child and young adult, how scouting helped me grow as a person, and, now, felt excitement about the opportunity being open to all children in this country.
